\section*{Statement}
\doublespacing
Earning the MIDAS Data Science certificate concurrently with my PhD in Political Science at the University of Michigan will help provide me with the methodological sophistication needed to complete my dissertation. 
I plan to use machine learning tools to identify the frequency of obstructive speech in legislative debates, and use this measure to predict the evolution of rules and norms governing legislative behavior in all 50 US states.
Towards this goal, I am working on a project with Professors Yuki Shiraito (University of Michigan - Political Science) and Ted Enamorado (UNC Chapel Hill - Political Science) to use an active learning approach in conjunction with Naive Bayes and EM text classification models to efficiently label text data.
Courses in the EECS department \textemdash EECS 505, 545, and the suite of EECS 598 classes in particular\textemdash that I plan to take in pursuit of the MIDAS Data Science certificate will provide me with with the expertise in data science and machine learning techniques needed in order to conduct this research.
In this way, my enrollment in the MIDAS Data Science certificate program will directly result in the use of data science and machine learning techniques to gain greater insight into the evolution of democratic institutions, as well as the conditions that contribute to democratic stability.
